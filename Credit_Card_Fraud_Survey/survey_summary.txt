Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection - Survey Analysis

Overview:
This document summarizes the key techniques, datasets, and findings from multiple research papers
and industry applications in the field of credit card fraud detection.

Covered Topics:
- Types of frauds (identity theft, fake cards, etc.)
- Common algorithms used: Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks
- Real-time detection vs. batch processing
- Publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggle credit card dataset)
- Evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F1-score

Insights:
- Machine learning models need to be highly sensitive to false positives.
- Imbalanced dataset handling is critical (undersampling/oversampling).
- Ensemble methods show better accuracy in many studies.

Conclusion:
Accurate fraud detection combines robust models with real-time monitoring systems.
